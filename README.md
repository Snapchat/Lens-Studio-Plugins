# Lens Studio 5 Plugins

This repository contains a collection of open-source Lens Studio plugins, categorized into three directories:

1. **Builtin**  
   These plugins are integrated into Lens Studio, allowing you to access them without explicit installation. They are considered essential features and primarily consist of [Presets](https://developers.snap.com/lens-studio/extending-lens-studio/plugins/overview#presets) that enable easy addition of predefined components and assets.

2. **Public**  
   Created for educational and demonstration purposes, these plugins, also known as example plugins, serve as tutorials that showcase key features of the editor scripting system with minimal code. If you're new to plugin development, these are an excellent starting point. For more details, explore the 'Public' folder and review the accompanying README file.

3. **Regular**  
   These plugins are typically found in the asset library and, unlike builtin plugins, usually require installation and can be uninstalled. They are generally more complex than the other two categories.

We encourage you to explore the repositories and code. For instructions on loading and testing a plugin locally, please refer to our [local installation guide](https://developers.snap.com/lens-studio/extending-lens-studio/plugins/overview#local-installation).
